The overview tab was designed before we did deep-dive passes on the risk, sentence and personal details designs. That work identified more of the complexity behind Delius’s data, and drew to light a lot of detail we didn’t have on our service.

Now that those tabs have been updated and there is a place for that information, we needed to reassess what information was most important when looking at the overview for a person on probation.

## User needs

As a probation practitioner I need to…

- see key identifiable information, so that I know I am looking at the right case
- see contact details, personal details and circumstances, so that I can understand their background
- know the offence and sentence, so that I can understand their case
- know if they are known to probation, so that I can find out what is known about them already
- see the details of scheduled appointments, so that I can carry out appointments
- see the risk associated with someone, so that I am prepared and can respond accordingly
- know if the information is accurate and up to date, so that I have an accurate picture of the person throughout

## Overview workshop

[Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_l5J0ifo=/)

Following a team workshop, where we looked at previous designs and research, we identified and prioritised what information we should show.

### Top priority

Things that need immediate attention:

- Alerts
- Failures to comply
- Recording attendance (or outcome)

### High priority
- A contact ‘card’ section – name, preferred name, CRN, date of birth and contact phone number (name, CRN and date of birth form a common set of details needed to identify someone on probation)
- Main offence, why they are on probation, what they did, in plain English
- When their next appointment is, date of first appointment
- Risk of harm, concerning behaviour, risk flags
- Links to risk management plan (RMP) and sentence plan (SP)
- Links to pre-sentence report – these reports usually contain a very good well-written summary of what’s happened and who a person is

### Medium priority

Things that show where someone is on their probation journey:

- Summary of compliance
- Sentence progression
- Type of sentence

### Lower priority

These were deemed less critical, but still give an indication of the person and their circumstances.

- Disabilities and adjustments
- Circumstances
- Indication that there is or isn’t a history on probation

## Design notes

The design also sought to:

- make the overview consistent with other tabs, in style and content
- provide a means of way-finding by showing the most important details, and linking to where related details live wihtin the service, for example name and circumstances with a link to personal details for more.

For top priority items a notification banner is used. If there are multiple things needing attention, they should show in priority order within the same banner.
